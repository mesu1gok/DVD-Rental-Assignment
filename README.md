# # DVD Rental Database - SQL Assignments

This repository contains my solutions for the **PostgreSQL** assignment series from the [Patika.dev](https://www.patika.dev) Data Science & Web Development path. 

The queries are performed on the well known `dvdrental` sample database, covering everything from basic filtering to advanced joins and table operations.

## Project Structure

Each folder represents a specific assignment and contains:
* A `.sql` file with the query solutions.
* A `.pdf` file with the assignment instructions or results.

## Covered Topics

### Part 1-5: Fundamentals
* **Assignment 1:** Basic `SELECT` statements, `WHERE` clause, and logical operators (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`).
* **Assignment 2:** Range filtering with `BETWEEN` and set filtering with `IN`.
* **Assignment 3:** Pattern matching using `LIKE` and `ILIKE`.
* **Assignment 4:** Distinct values (`DISTINCT`) and aggregate counting (`COUNT`).
* **Assignment 5:** Sorting results with `ORDER BY`, limiting output with `LIMIT`, and skipping rows with `OFFSET`.

### Part 6-8: Aggregation & Data Manipulation
* **Assignment 6:** Aggregate functions: `AVG()`, `MAX()`, `COUNT()`.
* **Assignment 7:** Grouping data with `GROUP BY` and filtering groups with `HAVING`.
* **Assignment 8:** Data Definition Language (**DDL**) & Data Manipulation Language (**DML**):
    * Creating tables.
    * Batch data insertion (Mockaroo).
    * `UPDATE` and `DELETE` operations.

### Part 9-10: Joins
* **Assignment 9:** Mastering `INNER JOIN` to combine multiple tables.
* **Assignment 10:** Understanding `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, and `FULL JOIN` mechanics.
